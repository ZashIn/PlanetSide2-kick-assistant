2. Set PlanetSide to window mode, sort Outfit member list (including offline) by name ascending, go to bottom of the list, click the uppermost entry.  
3. Use the button Delete & Scroll to delete the current inactive member (if marked in active row) and scroll synchronously to the next one.
4. Kick the member ingame (2 clicks and y key) and click the uppermost entry again.
5. Repeat from step 3.

You can use post an Outfit message ingame to notify about the cleanup process via button / hotkey.
